# Welcome to Asteroid 3D

## Introduction
Asteroid 3D is a browser-based game built with Three.js and Node. 
The goal of this project was to experiment with 3D interactivity while learning Three.js.

## Additional Info
During the creation of this project, I was able to add features on top of the Three.js library (pending approval) including a movement-inertia implementation that allows for smoother navigation through 3D space.
